# Three Shaders Collection

![Three Shaders Collection](public/og_image.webp)

Explore interactive WebGL shaders built with **Three.js** and **React**. This project features three unique experiences:

1. **Axel Rings**
   Interactive concentric rings that respond to mouse movement, allowing you to control speed, spacing, and color transitions.

2. **Sunset Raymarch**
   A dynamic sunset scene over the sea, where the sun position, lighting, and wave effects can be controlled with the mouse.

3. **Infinite Gallery**
   An infinite image scroll gallery powered by shaders, with smooth transitions, blur effects, and live interactions.
